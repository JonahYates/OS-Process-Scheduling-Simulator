# Process Scheduling Algorithms Project
#### Author: Jonah Yates, Drew Schulte, Selorm Sosuh

#### _Abstract_
Abstract â€“ This work explores the effects of: the process selection function, number of cores, number of processes, and process length on the occurrence of starvation in a given system. The algorithms in question are First-In First-Out (FIFO), Round Robin (RR), Shortest Process Next (SPN), Shortest Remaining Time (SRT), and Highest Response Ratio Next (HRRN). These are examined with respect to starvation.
